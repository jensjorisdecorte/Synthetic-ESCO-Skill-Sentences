This is the official repository containing the dataset that was used for the paper "Extreme Multi-Label Skill Extraction Training using Large Language Models". This dataset is a list of vacancy sentences, each tagged with an <cite>[ESCO][1]</cite> skill. The dataset is hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jensjorisdecorte/Synthetic-ESCO-skill-sentences). Finally, the full evaluation scores used in table 1 are available in this repository under the `eval` directory. The filenames correspond to the rows in the table.
